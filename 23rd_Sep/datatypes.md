JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language widely used for web development. Here are some key features of JavaScript:

[Interpreted-Language:] JavaScript is executed line by line in the browser, making it easier to debug and test code without the need for compilation.

[Dynamic-Typing:] Variables in JavaScript do not require a predefined data type. You can assign any type of value to a variable, and it can change during runtime.

[Prototype-Based-Object-Orientation:] JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

[First-Class-Functions:] Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.

[Asynchronous-Programming:] JavaScript supports asynchronous operations through callbacks, promises, and async/await, enabling non-blocking code execution.

[Event-Driven:] JavaScript is often used to create interactive web applications that respond to user events, such as clicks, keyboard input, and mouse movements.

[Rich-Ecosystem:] JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like Node.js, React, and Angular) that enhance its capabilities and simplify development.

[Cross-Platform:] JavaScript can run in any browser and on various devices, making it a versatile choice for web and mobile development.

[DOM-Manipulation:] JavaScript can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing developers to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to create interactive web pages.

[Support-for-JSON:] JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines, widely used for API communication

# 1. Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. There are three keywords to declare variables: let, const, and var.

let:

Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).
Block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block in which it is defined.
Can be reassigned.

let age = 25;
age = 26; // valid

# const:
Also introduced in ES6.
Block-scoped and cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.
Ideal for constants and references to objects/arrays.

const pi = 3.14;
// pi = 3.14159; // invalid, will throw an error
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); // valid, as the reference doesn't change
# var:

The original keyword for declaring variables.
Function-scoped or globally scoped, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
Can be reassigned and redeclared within the same scope.

var name = "Alice";
var name = "Bob"; // valid, redeclaration allowed
# 2. Data Types
JavaScript has several data types, which can be categorized into primitive types and reference types.

# Primitive Types: These are the most basic data types in JavaScript.

String: Represents a sequence of characters. Strings are enclosed in single, double, or backtick quotes.


let greeting = "Hello, world!";
let name = 'Alice';
let template = `Hello, ${name}!`; // Template literals
Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.


let age = 25;
let price = 19.99;
Boolean: Represents a logical entity that can have two values: true or false.


let isActive = true;
let isLoggedIn = false;
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a primitive type that signifies "no value".


let user = null; // user is explicitly set to no value
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.


let result; // result is undefined

Symbol: Introduced in ES6, symbols are unique and immutable values that can be used as object property keys. They are often used to avoid name clashes.
const uniqueKey = Symbol('description');

# Summary
let and const are preferred over var due to their block scope and reduced risk of variable hoisting issues.
Understanding primitive types is essential for effective JavaScript programming, as they help manage and manipulate data accurately.
